# Block Puzzle

This is a practice webpage for my introduction into web engineering module.

The goal is to create a webpage which allows the user to play a variety of sliding puzzle games similar to the game Rush Hour.

## Example

Rush Hour Game 1:

```
y=5: C3 C3 __ __ __ T4
y=4: T2 __ __ T3 __ T4
y=3: T2 R1 R1 T3 __ T4 <-- R1 needs to reach (4,3)(5,3)
y=2: T2 __ __ T3 __ __
y=1: C1 __ __ __ C2 C2
y=0: C1 __ T1 T1 T1 __
  x: 0  1  2  3  4  5
```
