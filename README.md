# Block Puzzle

This is a practice webpage for my introduction into web engineering module.

The goal is to create a webpage which allows the user to play a variety of sliding puzzle games similar to the game Rush Hour.

## Example

```
Rush Hour Game 1:
y=5: C3 C3 __ __ __ T4
y=4: T2 __ __ T3 __ T4
y=3: T2 R1 R1 T3 __ T4 <-- R1 needs to reach (4,3)(5,3)
y=2: T2 __ __ T3 __ __
y=1: C1 __ __ __ C2 C2
y=0: C1 __ T1 T1 T1 __
  x: 0  1  2  3  4  5


DirtyDozen Game 2:
y=4: R1 R1 G4 G5 G6 __
y=3: R1 R1 G1 G2 G3 __
y=2: B1 B1 B2 B2 B3 B3
y=1: Y1 Y1 Y2 Y3 Y3 Y4 <-- R1 needs to reach (4,1)(5,1)
y=0: Y1 Y2 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y4 <-- R1 needs to reach (4,0)(5,0)
  x: 0  1  2  3  4  5
```
